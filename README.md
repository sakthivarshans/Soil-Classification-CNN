 🌟 Project Overview

This project solves the problem of soil classification using image data and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to identify the type of soil from its image, which can assist in automated decision-making in the agriculture industry.

 🧠 Why CNN for Soil Classification?

We used CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) because it is the most effective architecture for image-based problems. CNNs automatically detect spatial patterns like texture and color—which are key to distinguishing soil types such as:

- Alluvial Soil
- Black Soil
- Red Soil
- Clay Soil

 📂 Dataset Details

The dataset contains:

- `train/`: Training images of different soil types.
- `test/`: Images used for prediction.
- `train_labels.csv`: Contains image filenames and corresponding soil types.
- `test_ids.csv`: Contains filenames for test images.
- `sample_submission.csv`: Template CSV to format model predictions.

Soil Types:
1. Alluvial Soil  
2. Black Soil  
3. Red Soil  
4. Clay Soil

 ▶️ How to Run the Model

 📍 Option 1: Using Kaggle or Colab Notebook

1. Upload the `Soil_Classification.ipynb` file.
2. Ensure the dataset path is correctly set inside the notebook.
3. Run all cells from top to bottom.

📍 Option 2: Run Locally (if converted to .py)

```bash
python run_model.py
```
